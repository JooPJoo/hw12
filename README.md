final project

Dancing Doll

A plush doll that will dance

## Summary

This project will have a plush doll that will dance by a remote control.  In order to achieve this, a plush doll will be gutted and built with mechanical and electrical parts.  A remote control will command the doll to dance certain moves.

Code will be written within arduino to include movements of the doll with the press of buttons on the remote control.

## Component Parts

Mechanical parts include, the doll itself, parts to make up the arms and head, servo motors, breadboard, jumper wires, arduino UNO, cardbaord to house the UNO and bread boards, balsa wood to create bone structure, IR sensor, remote control, and, batteries or USB cable.  The IR sensor will allow a remote control to send signals to the board in order to control the servo motors inside the doll.

Code that will be implemented include how the servo motors are controlled and buttons associated with the remote control to make the doll dance certain moves.
